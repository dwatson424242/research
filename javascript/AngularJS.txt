AngularJS is a library that can be included on a single page or throughout all of the pages. Once it is loaded, your page has MVC functionality. It connects easily to Firebase, and allows you to build dynamic apps.

It is useful for building Iphone style apps where most of the control needs to be on a few html pages. There is no need for a back-end with the code. 

Basically this allows you, in a single page, to have tons of functionality. For example, a mail interface like Gmail, etc. 

Angular is much more the C (Controller) part of MVC.
