BackboneJS is a JavaScript library that handles your data. It creates Models and Collections in which you can access your data from the back-end without all of the individual calls. It allows you to bring your data models directly to the JavaScript.

BackboneJS also has a RESTful model access in which it automatically communicates any changes to the back-end database.

It is basically an M (model) in MVC, and it allows you to easily integrate with other MVC style libraries.
